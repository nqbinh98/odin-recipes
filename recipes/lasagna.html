    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>
            Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.    
        </li>
        <li>
            Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
